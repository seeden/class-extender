# Class extender

## This module is deprecated please use ES6 instead this module.

## Motivation

As you know there is a lot of different class extenders. 
Maybe you ask yourself why another class extender. Answer is simple.
This is not a new class extender :) It is based on [Simple Javascript inheritance](http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/).
You can use this library as AMD, CommonJS or root library in your [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) or [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) module bundler.
Works in the browser, in [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/), [Bower](http://bower.io/) and with [Browserify](http://browserify.org/).

A couple things to note about this implementation:
 * Creating a constructor had to be simple (in this case simply providing an init method does the trick).
 * In order to create a new ‘class’ you must extend (sub-class) an existing class.
 * All of the ‘classes’ inherit from a single ancestor: Class. Therefore if you want to create a brand new class it must be a sub-class of Class.
 * And the most challenging one: Access to overridden methods had to be provided (with their context properly set). You can see this with the use of this._super(), above, calling the original init() and dance() methods of the Person super-class.

## Install

NodeJS:

	$ npm install class-extender

Bower:

	$ bower install class-extender

## Event emitter

If your are looking for simple event emitter library you can use [class-evented](https://github.com/seeden/class-evented) library

## Examples

Use as CommonJS module:

	var Class = require('class-extender');

	var Person = Class.extend({
		init: function(department) {
			this._department = department;
		},

		getDepartment: function() {
			return this.department;
		}
	});

	var Admin = Person.extend({
		init: function() {
			this._super('IT');
		},

		getDepartment: function() {
			return this._super() + ':)';
		}
	});

	var person = new Person('secretary');
	person.getDepartment(); // => 'secretary'

	var admin = new Admin();
	admin.getDepartment(); // => 'IT:)'

	admin instanceof Admin; // => true
	admin instanceof Person; // => true
	admin instanceof Class; // => true


Use as AMD module:
person.js:

	define(['class-extender'], function(Class) {
		return Class.extend({
			init: function(department) {
				this._department = department;
			},

			getDepartment: function() {
				return this.department;
			}
		});
	});

admin.js:

	define(['./person'], function(Person) {
		return Person.extend({
			init: function() {
				this._super('IT');
			},

			getDepartment: function() {
				return this._super() + ':)';
			}
		});
	});

test.js

	define(['class-extender', './person', './admin'], function(Class, Person, Admin) {

		var person = new Person('secretary');
		person.getDepartment(); // => 'secretary'

		var admin = new Admin();
		admin.getDepartment(); // => 'IT:)'

		admin instanceof Admin; // => true
		admin instanceof Person; // => true
		admin instanceof Class; // => true
	});

## Multiple inheritance

Basically this functionality is not supported. But there is one option.
You can copy own properties from existing classes. There is second parameter of function extend.

	Class.extend({
		init: function(name) {
			this._name = name;
		}
	}, [Person, AnotherClass]);
